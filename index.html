      <p> To whom it may concern! </p>
<p> Hi, coming from another country makes it possible for me to share my knowledge in the
domestic and international markets while also being open to learning more and growing my
knowledge for the benefit of the firm. I think that anything is possible and that any objective is
  reachable. </p> 
      <h3> Who is Adeel Quddus?</h3>
<p> I am a foreign student from Pakistan who moved to the US for further education. It was
difficult for me to leave my family and move to a developed nation where no one knew me or
anything about the culture. This task not only made me stronger, but it also demonstrates my
  willingness to accept difficulties and my will to succeed in them. </p>
<li> I've kept track of community college students academic records, demonstrating my
  professionalism in handling, and caring for important records.</li>
<li> I got the opportunity to interact with people of all nationalities while working at student
services because I interacted with many international students (reflects my
  communication skills).</li>
<li> Conducted orientation for incoming students, demonstrating my dean's high regard for
  me and my contributions.</li>
<li> When I was employed by Amazon, I ensured that the inventory was in order and that
  customers would receive the things they had requested.</li> 
      <li> During the busiest times of the year, I also helped the manager of the packing department
by checking that no items were missing and, if they were, ordering them and accelerating
        delivery to ensure customer satisfaction. </li>
<p>My resume will give you specific details about my previous employment history and areas of
specialization. I think what makes me unique is that despite the difficulties I encountered when
moving to the United States from another country and not knowing anyone or the culture, I was
  able to overcome them and keep moving forward.</p>

      <h3> What are you looking for? </h3>
<li> The environment of the business is crucial to me because I believe in our ability to grow
together. By this, I mean how well the business treats its employees and how fair it is to
its clients. In my opinion, if an employer treats an employee with respect, other
considerations become less significant to them, and they are more motivated to ensure
  that the business is successful and profitable.</li> 
<li> Fair treatment is another thing that's important to me. I don't support or believe in politics
or favoritism, and I think that an employee should be compensated for the labor and
  effort they put into the firm.</li>
<li> Don't limit me to a single job because it gets dull and won't allow me to progress and
  develop.</li>
<li> I support flexibility, which could apply to working conditions and hours. I could work
more effectively if my employer gave me the flexibility to choose my own hours and
  allowed me to work both from home and in the office.</li>
<li> As a business major, I believe that financial rewards do, to some extent, motivate
individuals, and I would seek compensation based solely on my education, my talents,
  and the value I will provide to the organization.</li> 
      <h3> When can I start? </h3>
<p> This coming December, I will graduate, and I'm ready to start working straight away. After
finishing my degree, I would love to continue working and being useful, while simultaneously
  taking care to avoid burning out.</p> 
      <br> Where are you located?</br>
<p> Corona, California is where I currently call home. Despite the fact that I would love to
  remain in California, I am open to new chances and relocating if the opportunity is worthwhile.</p>
    <h3> Why are you doing a “for hire” page?</h3>
<p>It enables me to provide a thorough background rather than just highlight my accomplishments.
Given that many resumes don't provide much information about the applicant, I believe it's
  crucial for hiring managers to be aware of the applicant's background as well as their resume.</p>

    <h3>How can I reach you?</h3>
<p>I value the time you took to listen to my experiences, what I as a person have to offer the
business, and what sets me apart from others. I've included a link to my resume, which contains
my contact information, so you may get in touch with me. Normally, I try to react within 24
  hours, but in an emergency, it can take me up to 48 hours.</p>
